#Android Dinner
*...if you have no time to breakfast, brunch or lunch.*

Android Dinner is a build script for comfortable and automated building
of Android Roms.

**NOTE**
The script Structure is taken from [andsens homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) (hopefully this is ok with him)

##Requirements:
For building ROMs using Android Dinner, you need:
- A working Android Build environment

##Features:
- Sync of the repositories

- parameter for 'no repo sync'
- cron mode (no output except warnings and above)
